That’s awesome’ (on getting good news for example),"Workplace, friends, customers ","I guess it’s a bit American but I think people in my generation don’t use as much ‘typical’ Aussie slang (eg bonzer, grouse) and use more common words like this. I also use ‘rad’ sometimes but I think I’m an outlier amongst my friends for that!",Yes,Shithouse,‘My first car was shithouse’,"School/uni friends (people my age), coworkers - informal scenarios like parties, hanging out, or chatting with coworkers in private (not in professional setting) ",Perhaps this is a bit of an older expression as well but I hear it quite a lot and I don’t think it being somewhat profane (?) really affects it as it’s so common!,Yes,Dickhead or dumbass ,"‘I can’t believe you thought that, what a dumbass’. ‘That dickhead just backed into my car.’","School/uni, nights out, chatting with friends. I think it’s more likely to have dickhead yelled at you by someone who’s angry though. Dumbass is a little bit softer (possibly more in a condescending way - oh, what a dumbass!)","I think dumbass is more American but I’ve heard a lot of people use it as a general way to say someone is stupid, including themselves, and sometimes affectionately. Dickhead can also be affectionate (haha) but I think it’s a bit more aggressive - like moron perhaps. Someone that cuts you off in traffic or behaves like an idiot. It could also be affectionate to call your mates dickheads though.  ",No,,,,,Yes,I guess? I wouldn’t use these. But I’ve heard hottie or looker ,She’s a looker / she’s a hottie ,"Not really around people my age, that I can recall, I think we’re more likely to just use an adjective (she’s hot). But among slightly older people perhaps",I don’t really use these but if someone around me used them I would understand them. I am familiar with some words like ‘dishy’ or ‘a dish’ or ‘spunk’ but heard those used more in my parents generation and I wouldn’t really use them except as a joke. ,Yes,Hot / hottie or maybe hunk ,He’s hot - he’s a hottie,Again I haven’t really heard this much! I more hear descriptors like ‘he’s hot’ ‘he’s cute’,"Ive heard my parents generation use dish, spunk, hunk, etc but no one my age really uses those. For me it’s hard to think of a typical expression that’s used often to describe this. ",Yes,"Fug, uggo, ugly mug (fugly as adjective)",‘She’s a real uggo’ - unfortunately usually hear the first two for females. I’ve heard guys greet each other with something like ‘oh it’s your ugly mug again’. Fugly was more common when I was in high school but I haven’t heard it recently. ,High school!!! Or with friends in casual conversation ,"This is very informal, not used if you had to be professional. May be used to insult your friend as a joke. There are so many Aussie expressions for this!! But maybe my friends are polite because I don’t hear a lot of them! ‘Minging’ is an example of one I know of but never really hear. Theres also ones I’ll hear for the first time snd only understand through context clues. Another older one I know is ‘a face only a mother could love’ or ‘a face for the radio’ but I would only use those as a joke. ",Yes,Up yourself / up himself ,"‘I hate that guy, he’s so up himself’","With friends, casual conversation, but also would use with coworkers as it’s not too uncommon and not overly offensive I think.  ",I feel like this is more common now than ‘stuck up’ or ‘cocky’ or any of those older descriptors. It seems quite common to me. ,Yes,"Rubbish, codswollop, load of shit / bullshit",My mum would use the first two- if I tell her something she doesn’t believe she would say ‘rubbish’ or ‘what a load of codswallop’. She also says things are ‘drivel’ or ‘tripe’ (she is 59).  Friends my age are more likely to say ‘that’s a load of shit’ or call ‘bullshit’.  ,"Informal - at home, with friends, hanging out. It might be someone calling you on a (potentially outrageous) claim you’ve made. ",I think people my age get all those older expressions but are more likely to use something involving shit / crap themselves. I don’t use a lot of ‘swear’ words so I might say ‘that’s ridiculous’ rather than say the noun. But it depends on social context. ,Yes,Plonk or goon,"‘I’ll bring some plonk(to the party)’ - would only refer to cheap alcohol, usually cheap wine. Goon is also cheap bagged wine. ","Parties, school friends, casual scenarios ",To me plonk feels a little older but I would still use it. Goon is pretty common but now that my friends and I are in our 30s we don’t drink it as much haha!,Yes,"Plastered, off his/her face, para, hammered … there are lots!",Did you see her at the party? She was plastered / hammered / para/ off her face ,"School and uni friends, at a party or at a casual event after a party, someone telling the story of their weekend….","There are so many expressions for this but if someone said a word I didn’t know, with this context, I would still know what it meant. I think para is short for paralysed and can also mean high potentially? Off his/her face can also mean this. As far as I’ve heard, plastered or hammered only means drunk.  ",Yes,"Bludger, slacker/slacko ","‘He never does anything, what a bludger’ - can also be a verb / bludging, slacking off","Casual conversation, share house (who does what job!!) and work (complaining about coworkers)","I personally don’t think bludger or slacker gives the full meaning of someone who doesn’t contribute their full share of something (although it CAN). I think there might be another word for that, that escapes me right now. For me blushing and slacking can mean that but can also just mean lazy. Eg a dole bludger. ",No,,,,,,Yes,Arvo,Afternoon,‘Come over this arvo’ ,In pretty much any context - even in a professional workplace ,,Yes,Bogan,An uncultured person (kind of classist though- usually an uncultured poor white person from a poor or rural area) ,‘Frankston is full of bogans’,Everywhere! Mainly in casual situations with friends or colleagues ,Super common!,Yes,"Chuck a sickie, pull a sickie",Taking a sick day but likely/probably not actually being sick ,"‘He’s not here for the test, he chucked a sickie’","School, uni, work….",Very common and usually means you’re sceptical of the persons illness (insinuate it’s not genuine),No,,,,,,,,,,,
